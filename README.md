## What's inside
BottomNavigationView is a new control since Android Support Design v25. This source code demonstrate the way to bring it into Xamarin.Forms.

However, BottomNavigationView is very limited from customizing, we have to employ library BottomNavigationViewEx as a patch.

In this code, we have
- A custom BottomTabbedPage
- A custom BottomTabbedRenderer

We could 
- change color of background, text of the bar, each item
- chagne the height of the bar
- change text typeface

```

### Change the root element to BottomTabbedPage (change the code behind as well)
```xml
<naxam:BottomTabbedPage

### Change the colors/heights in your activity class
```c#
BottomTabbedRenderer.BackgroundColor = new Android.Graphics.Color(23, 31, 50);
BottomTabbedRenderer.FontSize = 10;
BottomTabbedRenderer.IconSize = 20;
BottomTabbedRenderer.ItemTextColor = stateList;
BottomTabbedRenderer.ItemIconTintList = stateList;
BottomTabbedRenderer.Typeface = Typeface.CreateFromAsset(this.Assets, "HiraginoKakugoProNW3.otf");
BottomTabbedRenderer.ItemBackgroundResource = Resource.Drawable.bnv_selector;
BottomTabbedRenderer.ItemSpacing = 8;
BottomTabbedRenderer.ItemPadding = new Xamarin.Forms.Thickness(8);
BottomTabbedRenderer.BottomBarHeight = 80;
BottomTabbedRenderer.ItemAlign = BottomTabbedRenderer.ItemAlignFlags.Center;
```

### Use Iconize for menu item
```c#
BottomTabbedRenderer.MenuItemIconSetter = (menuItem, iconSource) => {
    var iconized = Iconize.FindIconForKey(iconSource.File);
    if (iconized == null)
    {
        BottomTabbedRenderer.DefaultMenuItemIconSetter.Invoke(menuItem, iconSource);

        return;
    }

    var drawable = new IconDrawable(this, iconized).Color(Color.White).SizeDp(20);
